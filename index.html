        <div id="info-section-2">This project was a blast to build! What seemed like a tiny project was actually a pretty scalable one with so many features that I had the chance to implement.<br><br>The main thing I take away from this project is that modularity/encapsulation is key - the tools, like the fill tool and the pen tool, are different functions - allowing me to edit their properties without disturbing the other functions. I also got a good taste of how to allow users to download things, a core feature of applications!<br><br> It was a great way to learn to use JavaScript efficiently, and I hope you think it's neat! Thank you so much for your time and for checking it out!</div>
