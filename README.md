Hi! I'm Nate. Welcome to my pixel creator.

AS OF RIGHT NOW, THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! I will update regularly.

I created this as a way to show some of my JavaScript and TypeScript skills. 

Design Decisions:
I chose not to use React for this because this project isn't complex enough for it - I could do it in React easily, though!

Features:
    - Fill tool - fills all the cells around the chosen cell
    - Save - the user can download the image to their computer
    - Pen tool - can draw with variable radius
    - Color switching - can choose any color to draw with
    - Erase tool - can erase the cells (also with a variable radius)
    - Clear canvas - can clear the canvas
